      <h1>What Goes into a Trading Bot?</h1>
      <p>Embarking on the journey of automated cryptocurrency trading with Luxabot entails a setup process which is instrumental in tailoring the trading bot to one's specific needs and strategies. Each criterion in the setup phase holds significance in ensuring the bot operates optimally under Luxabots internal programs. The following items are what the user will see when setting up a new bot with an excerpt as to why this is a neccesary field:
        <br>
        <br>
        <strong>Bot Name:</strong>
            Assigning a unique name to your bot is fundamental for identification purposes. This unique identifier aids in organizing, managing, and distinguishing between different bots you may create over time on the Luxabot platform.
        <br>
        <br>
        <strong>Exchange Selection:</strong>
            The choice of cryptocurrency exchange is crucial as it's the arena where your bot will execute trades. Different exchanges like Binance US, Coinbase, Kraken, and BitForex, have varying offerings, fee structures, and supported cryptocurrency pairs. Your bot needs to operate on an exchange that aligns with your trading goals and supports the cryptocurrency pairs you intend to trade.
        <br>
        <br>
        <strong>Margin Trading:</strong>
        Luxabot's integration with Coinmetro uniquely includes the ability to engage in margin trading. This feature allows your bot to trade with leveraged funds, offering the potential for higher returns while also increasing risk exposure. When setting up your bot for Coinmetro, you have the option to enable margin trading, allowing for more advanced trading strategies. It's important to configure margin trading settings carefully, understanding the risks and mechanics involved, as this is a powerful tool that can significantly impact your trading outcomes. Coinmetro is currently the only exchange that supports margin trading through Luxabot.
        <br>
        <br>        
        <strong>Crypto Pairing:</strong>
            Specifying the cryptocurrency pairing is pivotal as it defines the market your bot will trade in. Whether you aim to trade Bitcoin against US Dollars (BTC/USD) or any other pair, this criterion is the bedrock of your trading strategy.
        <br>
        <br>
        <strong>Order Type:</strong>
            Choosing the order type determines how your bot will execute trades in the market. Whether it's market orders or limit orders, this choice impacts how your bot reacts to market conditions and potentially affects your trading outcomes.
        <br>
        <br>
        <strong>Webhook Setup:</strong>
            The webhook setup is a technical cornerstone for enabling communication between Luxabot and your chosen exchange. Entering the correct API public and private keys is essential for authenticating and securing the communication channel between Luxabot and the exchange, ensuring your bot can execute trades on your behalf securely.
        <br>
        <br>
        <strong>Secondary Authentication Password:</strong>
        Coinmetro requires a secondary authentication password for third-party apps like Luxabot to access your account. This additional password is crucial for maintaining the security of your Coinmetro account while allowing Luxabot to perform trading activities on your behalf. It's a necessary step to integrate Luxabot with Coinmetro, ensuring that your trading activities remain secure and authorized. Coinmetro is the only site that Luxabot will need a secondary authentication password for.
        <br>
        <br>
        <strong>Capital Management:</strong>
            The method of capital management you choose, whether it's "Equity" or "Static Value", governs how your bot manages the funds allocated for trading. This choice is instrumental in risk management and ensuring your bot operates within your financial comfort zone.
        <br>
        <br>
        <strong>Equity or Static Value:</strong>
            Depending on your choice of capital management, specifying the equity value or static value is vital. This value dictates the amount of capital your bot will utilize for each trade, thus impacting your risk exposure and potential returns.
        <br>
        <br>
        <strong>Starting Capital:</strong>
            Entering the initial capital is important for estimating the bot’s performance. Although it doesn’t directly interact with your exchange account, it serves as a basis for tracking performance and understanding the potential growth of your investment.
        <br>
        <br>
        <strong>TradingView Integration via Webhooks:</strong>
            Integrating TradingView through webhooks enriches your bot with a powerful analytical tool. By setting up signals via TradingView, you empower your bot with a framework to interpret market conditions and execute trades based on pre-defined criteria. This integration is instrumental in automating your trading strategies and reacting to market conditions in real-time.
        <br>
        <br>
        Each of these criteria is a building block in creating a robust and efficient trading bot on Luxabot. The thoughtful provision of these details ensures that your bot is well-equipped to navigate the cryptocurrency market and work towards achieving your trading objectives. Through a user-centric setup process, Luxabot strives to provide a seamless and enriching automated trading experience, placing control and customization in the hands of the user.
